# Functions For analysis of spine distributions
Thank you for your interest in our work

Included are a number of computational tools for the analysis of synapse distribution in dendritic branches as used in our recent publication: "Excitatory and inhibitory synapses show a tight subcellular correlation that weakens over development"

Software is organized by Platforms. 

IgorPro software was used to transform Synaptic Regions of Interest and Branch tracings identified using FIJI from confocal or SBFSEM images stacks into simplified Summary Data Tables. These data tables can be used to analyze correlation of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic distribution at the whole branch level as shown in Figures 1E, 2H and S2A.

MATLAB software was used to analyze the Summary Data Tables, for sub-branch analysis of synaptic distributions and bootstrapping analysis. The data is displayed in Figures 1F, 1H, 2J and S2B-F.

Find more detailed description on the dedicated README files for each platform inside the folders.
